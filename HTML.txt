How to start..
<br>
goto your desktop and right click
make a new folder and name it whatever you want!
in side that floder
Right click and hover over create new make a txt file and rename it to index.html (you can name it whatever you want!)

Great! Now when you open index.html it should open a webpage it shouldnt have anything on it

How do I get the html file??
You can open a HTML file with MOST notepad programes (I like notepad++ but you can use the defalut notpad editor)

Now copy and paste the code below and open ur index.html again! Now you should see some text! (code starts at line 25 and ends at 45)
Now rember you MUST have a closing if you dont ur whole site will be messed up!

Bold text = <b> Text Here </b>
Wanna center text? do <center>  <p> text here <p>  </center>
(The P stands for paragraph)
You can also do headings!
<h1> This is Header 1 <h1>
<h2> This is header 2 <h2>
ATM there are 6 headers to use



<html>
  <head>
    <title> This is where you inport css and put ur title </title>
    you can inport a css like this
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
    The herf part is a LINK
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <p> Text here </p
      
    So you could do this for a clickable link
   <a href="HTTPS://YOUTUBE.COM"> put the TEXT HERE</a>
   Wanna got anther part of ur site?
   make a new folder and put a new index.html
    this is how you would get to it via the site
    
   <a href="/minecraft/index.html">My minecraft stuff!</a>
  </body>
</html>
 If you need anyhelp with HTML/css I would use <a herf="https://www.w3schools.com/cs">w3schools</a>
