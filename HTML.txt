How to start..
<br>
goto your desktop and right click
make a new folder and name it whatever you want!
in side that floder
Right click and hover over create new make a txt file and rename it to index.html (you can name it whatever you want!)

Great! Now when you open index.html it should open a webpage it shouldnt have anything on it

How do I get the html file??
You can open a HTML file with MOST notepad programes (I like notepad++ but you can use the defalut notpad editor)

Now copy and paste the code below and open ur index.html again! Now you should see some text!

<html>
  <head>
    <title> This is where you inport css and put ur title </title>
    you can inport a css like this
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
    The herf part is a LINK
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <p> Text here </p
      
    So you could do this for a clickable link
   <a href="HTTPS://YOUTUBE.COM"> put the TEXT HERE</a>
   Wanna got anther part of ur site?
   make a new folder and put a new index.html
    this is how you would get to it via the site
    
   <a href="/minecraft/index.html">My minecraft stuff!</a>
  </body>
</html>
 If you need anyhelp with HTML/css I would use <a herf="https://www.w3schools.com/cs">w3schools</a>
