## Hi there :wave:
<br> <br>
I love HTML bc its easy
<br>
no joke anyone can learn it
<br>
Just goto ur desktop right click make new file
<br>
and do
<br>

<-- <html>
  <head>
    <title> This is where you inport css and put ur title </title>
    you can inport a css like this
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
    The herf part is a LINK
    
    
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> Text here </p
      
    So you could do this for a clickable link
   <a href="HTTPS://YOUTUBE.COM"> put the TEXT HERE</a>
   Wanna got anther part of ur site?
   make a new folder and put a new index.html
    this is how you would get to it via the site
    
   <a href="/minecraft/index.html">My minecraft stuff!</a>
  </body>
</html>
