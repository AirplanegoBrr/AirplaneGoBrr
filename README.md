## Hi there :wave:

I used to code in python but now I code in javascript like a normal person ðŸ˜„ (coff coff DevFlock coff)

My main project right now are my twitch bot and my discod bot. (Mainly the twitch bot)

My best "bud" is probably [DevFlock](https://github.com/DevFlock)

I'm also 15 but dont sound/act/look like it.

I also have my own website (thats hella slow)
