## CopyRight

How my copyright works is VERY simple. Just put (some where on your project/website (it can even be a comment in the HTML/code ok??)) 

"some code was sorced from AirplaneGobrr(APGB)"
  
I ask you just follow it please. Its very simple. I won't enforce it but I ask out of the kindness of my heart that you do <3

You can add what code was used if you would like
